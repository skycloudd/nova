# Hello World

As with any programming tutorial, lets start with a simple demonstration program.

```ruby
let my_number = 1 + 2 * 3;

if my_number == 7 then
    action print: 3;
end
```

Output:

```ruby
3
```

## Explanation

```ruby
let my_number = 1 + 2 * 3;
```

This line assigns the value `7` to a variable called `my_number`. That means we can simply use its name in other places in the code and get the number `7` back.

Next, we have a so called "if statement".

```ruby
if my_number == 7 then
    action print: 3;
end
```

This says that if the variable `my_number` is _equal_ to the number `7`, we print the number `3`. Of course with this program that is always the case.
